## Core Features:

- Telegram Authentication: Allow users to log in to the application by authenticating with their Telegram account using their phone number, leveraging Telegram's API to send a login code to their saved messages.
- Media Upload: Enable users to upload various types of media files (images, videos, documents, etc.) to the app. On upload, the files are sent and stored in the user's Telegram 'Saved Messages' using the Telegram API.
- Media Retrieval & Display: Fetch media files stored in the user's Telegram 'Saved Messages' using Telegram API and display them in an organized and visually appealing dashboard within the TeleDrive application.
- Search and Filter: Implement robust search and filter options within the dashboard, enabling users to quickly locate specific media files based on name, type, or date added.
- AI-powered Tagging: Use a tool to suggest relevant tags for uploaded media based on its content. These tags will make content searchable using natural language queries.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#4186F7) for trust, modernity, and the feeling of 'cloud' storage.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) creates a clean, airy feel without stark contrast.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) will be used on interactive elements for excellent contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, offering a geometric and modern feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, offering readability and warmth.
- Use a set of modern, flat design icons for file types and actions. Icons should use the primary color (#4186F7) on hover to indicate interactivity.
- The dashboard layout will be clean and intuitive, featuring a prominent search bar, a well-organized file display area (grid or list view), and easy-to-access navigation.
- Subtle animations on file uploads and screen transitions to enhance the user experience, creating a sense of fluidity and responsiveness.
